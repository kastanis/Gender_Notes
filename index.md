# Gender Roles
Understanding Gender Diversity can help your school __provide a supportive, non-discriminatory environment for all students__, including gender diverse and transgender children. There are plenty of resources to help administrators, teachers, and staff gently move from awareness to action in order to create more inclusive learning and social environments. 

We know that the numbers for young people who identify as gender diverse in Generation Z and younger is high, estimated at least one in ten, according to the [American Psychological Association](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/nearly-1-10-teens-identify-gender-diverse-pittsburgh-study-rcna993). So it totally makes sense to us that CEE would want to be up to date on the current climate with their students. 

We know that when we were in Toddlers there was professional development in implicit bias in early childhood education, with regards to race and skin color, and we’re hoping there can be some investment in exploring implicit bias around gender too. We’re happy to partner with you in any way that we can. Attentiveness to the equity and diversity in gender identity in schools can help create a solid and positive foundation for all children's future identity development.

## Definitions
_Gender identity_ - Gender means how you feel inside. It’s your innermost feeling of maleness, femaleness, a blend of both or neither. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. 

_Pronouns_ -  It’s respectful and supportive to use a person’s preferred pronouns. But just like gender, you can’t tell what someone’s pronouns are just by looking at them. Don’t assume. If you’re unsure of the pronouns of someone new, rather than assuming, [Hunter Chinn-Raicht](https://www.care.com/c/explaining-they-them-pronouns) suggests sharing your own and opening the door for them to share theirs. “I like to say, ‘Hi, I’m Hunter, and I use they/them pronouns,’” they explain. In other situations, if they know the name but not pronouns, they might say, “Hey I think you’re cool. What are your pronouns?’”

Example Questions To Ask: 
  - “What do you feel is your gender?”
  - “Are you boy, girl, both or neither?”
  - “Are you boy, girl, or nonbinary?”

## Language Matters!
Avoid gender-specific language when speaking to your class. Be aware that sometimes we use boy-girl language where some kids can’t find a place for themselves. Instead of calling your students to attention with “boys and girls …” get their attention in different ways. Say “kids” or “children” or “students.” 

Don’t assume the gender of someone in a book you are reading. Say “kid” instead.

## Teaching Bystander Intervention Techniques To Help Prevent Bullying
Some helpful tips on teaching kids how to intervene and stand up for their friends when others are being excluded or hurt:
  - Have them explore their ideas about gender identity and think about what is or is not fair with respect to gender.
  - Teach them ways to address hurtful gender put-down.
  - Honor children when they stand up for themselves or others in the face of gender bias.   

## Trainings & Professional Development:
Some teachers may lack confidence in their abilities to provide effective information on gender diversity. So we’d love to point out at least two educator training programs to help inform teachers on these topics across all grade levels at CEE. 
Gender Spectrum is a great resource for schools. They do professional development trainings (read more here) and hold a yearly symposium around timely topics (read more here).  
Gender Diversity trainings provide accurate, up-to-date, accessible information regarding the best practices schools can implement to create an inclusive environment for all students, regardless of gender status, and on an age-appropriate level. Learn more about them here.
